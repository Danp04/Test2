> Today the awareness of technical communication as a field of knowledge is growing, and here, in Poland, it's growing faster than ever. <cite>Michal Skowron and Jakub Wisniewski, Poland for [I'd rather be writing](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/10/31/untold-story-of-techwriter-pl-poland/)</cite>


### Origins

In Poland, there has long been a portal for IT software testers, [Testerzy.pl](https://testerzy.pl/). However, there wasn't any source of information for people involved in the broadly defined technical communications industry. In 2013, Dariusz Drezno, a Polish software testing expert came up with the idea of a portal for the Polish tech writers, [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/).
