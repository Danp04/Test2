### Origins of Techwriter.pl

In Poland, there has long been a portal for IT software testers, [Testerzy.pl](https://testerzy.pl/). However, there wasn't any source of information for people involved in the broadly defined technical communications industry. 

In 2013, Dariusz Drezno, a Polish software testing expert came up with the idea of a portal for the Polish tech writers, [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/). With its ups and downs it is now the most reliable source of knowledge for the local industry professionals. Apart from information about Poland and the world, it provides job offers, salary surveys, interviews, lots of training materials, and interesting articles.

For more details about the origins of [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/) and its contributors read the article by Tom Johnson: [The Untold Story of Techwriter.pl](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/10/31/untold-story-of-techwriter-pl-poland/).


### Content events

Poland's range of the industry conferences and meetings have been a mainstay of the local calendar since 2013. The meetings, supported by online outreach and social media, bring together local tech comm enthusiasts, allowing them to gain knowledge and share experiences. 

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, meetings and conferences have moved online or have been rescheduled.

#### Soap! Conference

One of the largest content conference in Poland is [Soap!](http://soapconf.com/). By coincidence, the first [Soap!](http://soapconf.com/) conference took place on the day of the [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/) portal start-up. Over time [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/) has become a [Soap!](http://soapconf.com/) conference partner. 

Reach out the [Soap!](http://soapconf.com/) social media platform on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/soapconf/) to keep up to date if you're interested.

#### Meet Content

[Meet Content](http://meetcontent.org/) or Meet-up events connect the industry professionals on a local level. Through local meetings, a network of people who have been in the same or similar field expands. They share experiences, learn from each other, improve themselves.
