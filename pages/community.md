### Origins of Techwriter.pl

In Poland, there has long been a portal for IT software testers, [Testerzy.pl](https://testerzy.pl/). However, there wasn't any source of information for people involved in the broadly defined technical communications industry. 

In 2013, Dariusz Drezno, a Polish software testing expert came up with the idea of a portal for the Polish tech writers, [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/). With its ups and downs it is now the most reliable source of knowledge for the local industry professionals. Apart from information about Poland and the world, it provides job offers, salary surveys, interviews, lots of training materials, and interesting articles.

For more details about the origins of [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/) and its contributors read the article by Tom Johnson: [The Untold Story of Techwriter.pl](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/10/31/untold-story-of-techwriter-pl-poland/).


### Content events

Poland's range of the industry conferences and meetings have been a mainstay of the local calendar since 2013. The meetings, supported by online outreach and social media, bring together local tech comm enthusiasts, allowing them to gain knowledge and share experiences. 

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, meetings and conferences have moved online or have been rescheduled.

#### Soap! Conference

One of the largest content conference in Poland is [Soap!](http://soapconf.com/). By coincidence, the first [Soap!](http://soapconf.com/) conference took place on the day of the [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/) portal start-up. Over time [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/) has become a [Soap!](http://soapconf.com/) conference partner. 

Reach out the [Soap!](http://soapconf.com/) social media platform on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/soapconf/) to keep up to date if you're interested.

#### Meet Content

[Meet Content](http://meetcontent.org/) or Meet-up events connect the industry professionals on a local level. Through local meetings, a network of people who have been in the same or similar field expands. They share experiences, learn from each other, improve themselves. These meetings are quite popular in Cracow, Wroclaw, and Gdansk.


### Online journey

With the development of technology, many things happen online. Although you can associate the online environment mostly with written activities, today's reality has revealed the potential of live online events and remote work. High interaction of people on the web encourages the formation of industry sub-groups. The Polish tech comm passionates have also gone viral. 

After the [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/) portal was created, over time the team decided to set up linkedin, facebook, and twitter. Follow the links below to check it yourself but the content is in the Polish language:
* [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/techwriter-pl/)
* [twitter](https://twitter.com/techwriterpl)

The following groups grow at a fast pace:
1. [Madcap Flare users group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PLFUG) 
2. [Documentation practices-related Polish group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tworzeniedokumentacji) created by [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/) team

A recently created activity is podcast, [Tech Writer koduje](https://techwriterkoduje.pl/) [eng, Tech Writer codes]. It's also in the Polish native language, and addresses aspects that make the work of tech writers easier.



The online groups can be your starting point in a community development. It's quite easy to organize but more difficult to keep members active.     

To create an online group you need:
* rules and regulations
* predefined goals
* a moderator or moderators to encourage involvement
* a legacy plan
